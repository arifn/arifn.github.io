Hi there :wave:,

I am an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Computer Science and Electronics, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Universitas Gadjah Mada](https://dcse.fmipa.ugm.ac.id/site/en/welcome/). My research interests lie primarily in data mining and software engineering. Currently, I focus on developing automated approaches to support software development. Previously, I completed my PhD in Software Engineering from Monash University. During my PhD, I investigated and developed an AI-based tool to incorporate human values in software development.
