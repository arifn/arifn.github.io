Hi there :wave:,

I currently serve as an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computer Science and Electronics, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Universitas Gadjah Mada](https://dcse.fmipa.ugm.ac.id/site/en/welcome/). My research is centered on data mining and software engineering, with a particular emphasis on creating automated solutions to enhance software development processes. I am also deeply committed to leveraging technology for social good, focusing on projects that address environmental sustainability and support underrepresented communities.

I earned my PhD in Software Engineering from Monash University, where my research focused on AI-enabled approaches to identifying and mitigating ethical and human-centric considerations in software development. I also serve as a reviewer for Journal of Systems and Software (https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-systems-and-software), Information and Software Technology (https://www.journals.elsevier.com/information-and-software-technology), and SoftwareX (https://www.journals.elsevier.com/softwarex).
