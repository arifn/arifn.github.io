Hi there :wave:,

I am an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Computer Science and Electronics, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Universitas Gadjah Mada](https://dcse.fmipa.ugm.ac.id/site/en/welcome/). My research interests lie primarily in the fields of data mining and software engineering. Currently, I focus on developing automated approaches to support software development.

Previously, I completed my PhD in Software Engineering from Monash University, co-advised by [Prof. Jon Whittle](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=igMJAZwAAAAJ&hl=en) (now in CSIRO's Data61, Australia), [Prof. Michel Chaudron](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Y_0xou4AAAAJ&hl=en) (Eindhoven University of Technology, the Netherlands), [Dr. Mojtaba Shahin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Aml0q7sAAAAJ) (now in RMIT, Australia), and [Dr. Waqar Hussain](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=i4hbSqoAAAAJ) (now in CSIRO's Data61, Australia). During my PhD, I investigated and developed a tool to incorporate human values in software development.
