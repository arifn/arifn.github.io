Hi there :wave:,

I currently serve as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Electronics at the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Universitas Gadjah Mada. My research is centered on data mining and software engineering, with a particular emphasis on creating automated solutions to enhance software development processes. I am also deeply committed to leveraging technology for social good, focusing on projects that address environmental sustainability and support underrepresented communities.

I hold a PhD in Software Engineering from Monash University, where I specialized in developing AI-driven tools to integrate human values into software design. My doctoral research culminated in the creation of an innovative AI-based framework aimed at aligning software development practices with ethical and human-centric principles. This work has fueled my ongoing passion for building technology that is not only efficient but also socially responsible.
