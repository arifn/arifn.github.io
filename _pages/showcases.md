#### Human Values Dashboard

Human values dashboard is a dashboard that presents the presence of human values in software repository artefacts. This dashboard was developed as a result of my PhD study. The dashboard serves as a proof of concept to showcase the results of human values detection in issue discussions to software practitioners. 

**Status**: The server is currently down and under maintenance.
