  abstract  = {In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract  = {Role stereotypes indicate generic roles that classes play in the design of software systems (e.g. controller, information holder, or interfacer). Knowledge about the role-stereotypes can help in various tasks in software development and maintenance, such as program understanding, program summarization, and quality assurance. This paper presents an automated machine learning-based approach for classifying the role-stereotype of classes in Java. We analyse the performance of this approach against a manually labelled ground truth for a sizable open source project (of 770+ Java classes) for the Android platform. Moreover, we compare our approach to an existing rule-based classification approach. The contributions of this paper include an analysis of which machine learning algorithms and which features provide the best classification performance. This analysis shows that the Random Forest algorithm yields the best classification performance. We find however, that the performance of the ML-classifier varies a lot for classifying different role-stereotypes. In particular its performs degrades for rare role-types. Our ML-classifier improves over the existing rule-based classification method in that the ML-approach classifies all classes, while rule-based approaches leave a significant number of classes unclassified.},
